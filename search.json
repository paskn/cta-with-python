    "text": "2 Introduction: Why Text as Data?\nText is everywhere: social media posts, news articles, scientific papers, government documents, customer reviews. But text in its raw form is unstructured - it’s just sequences of characters. To analyze text computationally, we need to transform it into structured data that computers can process mathematically.\nThink of it this way: if you wanted to compare two novels, you could read both and form an impression. But what if you had 1,000 novels? Or 100,000 tweets? This is where computational text analysis becomes essential.\n\n2.1 Our Dataset: State of the Union Addresses\nToday we’ll work with a collection of State of the Union addresses - speeches given by US presidents from the 18th century to 2018. These speeches are:\n\nHistorical: Spanning over 200 years\nPolitical: Reflecting different eras and priorities\nComparable: Same genre, same occasion, different authors\n\nThis makes them perfect for learning text analysis techniques.\nData source: Brian Weinstein’s State of the Union corpus"

    "text": "5 From Text to Tokens - The Bag of Words Model\n\n5.1 The Challenge: Text is Unstructured\nRight now, our transcript column contains long strings of text. How do we measure or compare them? We can’t easily do math on text!\n\n\n5.2 The Solution: Tokenization\nTokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units called tokens. Usually, tokens are words, but they could also be:\n\nCharacters (letters)\nSentences\nN-grams (sequences of N words)\n\nLet’s see this in action:\n\n# Simple example: split text into words\nexample = \"Python is great for text analysis\"\nwords = example.split()\nprint(\"Original text:\", example)\nprint(\"Tokens (words):\", words)\nprint(\"Number of tokens:\", len(words))\n\nOriginal text: Python is great for text analysis\nTokens (words): ['Python', 'is', 'great', 'for', 'text', 'analysis']\nNumber of tokens: 6\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Tokenizing Our Speeches\nNow let’s tokenize one full speech:\n\n# Get one speech\nspeech_text = speeches.loc[0, 'transcript']\n\n# Simple tokenization (just splitting on spaces)\nsimple_tokens = speech_text.split()\n\nprint(f\"Speech length: {len(speech_text)} characters\")\nprint(f\"Number of tokens: {len(simple_tokens)}\")\nprint(f\"\\nFirst 20 tokens:\")\nprint(simple_tokens[:20])\n\nSpeech length: 30354 characters\nNumber of tokens: 5190\n\nFirst 20 tokens:\n['Mr.', 'Speaker,', 'Mr.', 'Vice', 'President,', 'Members', 'of', 'Congress,', 'the', 'First', 'Lady', 'of', 'the', 'United', 'States,', 'and', 'my', 'fellow', 'Americans:', 'Less']\n\n\n\n\n5.4 The Bag of Words Model\nOnce we have tokens, we can treat text as a “bag of words” - we:\n\nIgnore word order (“cat dog” = “dog cat”)\nCount word frequencies\nRepresent text as numbers\n\nThis might seem like we’re throwing away information (word order matters!), but this simple model is surprisingly powerful for many tasks.\nLet’s create a bag of words for one speech:\n\n# Count word frequencies\nword_counts = Counter(simple_tokens)\n\n# Show most common words\nprint(\"Top 15 most frequent words:\")\nfor word, count in word_counts.most_common(15):\n    print(f\"  {word}: {count}\")\n\nTop 15 most frequent words:\n  the: 215\n  and: 184\n  to: 175\n  of: 121\n  our: 95\n  we: 88\n  a: 79\n  in: 72\n  is: 61\n  are: 48\n  that: 45\n  --: 44\n  have: 40\n  for: 34\n  will: 34\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Two Data Formats: Long vs Wide\nWe can represent tokenized text in two ways:\nLong format: One row per word occurrence\npresident    word\nTrump        the\nTrump        economy\nTrump        is\nTrump        strong\nWide format: One row per document, one column per unique word\npresident    the    economy    is    strong\nTrump        150    12         89    5\nFor now, we’ll work with long format because it’s easier to understand and manipulate."

    "text": "10 Introduction to Stylometry\n\n10.1 What is Stylometry?\nStylometry is the statistical analysis of writing style. It’s used to:\n\nAttribute authorship: Who wrote this anonymous text?\nDetect plagiarism: Did someone copy another’s style?\nStudy literary history: How did an author’s style evolve?\nForensics: Analyze threatening letters or disputed documents\n\n\n\n10.2 The Surprising Power of Function Words\nYou might think content words (nouns, verbs) reveal writing style. But actually, function words (the stop words we just removed!) are more revealing because:\n\nUnconscious use: Authors don’t think about them\nHigh frequency: Provide strong statistical signal\n\nStable patterns: Less affected by topic\nIndividual variation: People use them differently\n\n\n\n10.3 A Simple Example\nDifferent presidents might discuss the same topics but use different grammatical structures:\n\n“We must ensure…” vs “I believe we must…”\n“This is important” vs “This has been important”\n“The people” vs “Our people”\n\nThese tiny differences add up to distinctive “stylistic fingerprints.”\n\n\n10.4 Analyzing Presidential Style\nLet’s look at how often different presidents use personal pronouns:\n\n# Define personal pronouns\npersonal_pronouns = ['i', 'me', 'my', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'you', 'your']\n\n# Filter for pronouns only\npronoun_df = tokens_df[tokens_df['word'].isin(personal_pronouns)].copy()\n\n# Count by president\npronoun_by_president = (pronoun_df.groupby(['president', 'word'])\n                        .size()\n                        .reset_index(name='count'))\n\n# Calculate total words per president for normalization\nwords_per_president = tokens_df.groupby('president').size()\n\n# Normalize (calculate rate per 1000 words)\npronoun_by_president = pronoun_by_president.merge(\n    words_per_president.reset_index(name='total_words'),\n    on='president'\n)\npronoun_by_president['rate_per_1000'] = (\n    (pronoun_by_president['count'] / pronoun_by_president['total_words']) * 1000\n)\n\n# Show some examples\nprint(\"Sample of pronoun usage rates (per 1000 words):\")\nprint(pronoun_by_president[pronoun_by_president['president'].isin(\n    ['Donald J. Trump', 'Barack Obama', 'George W. Bush']\n)].head(15))\n\nSample of pronoun usage rates (per 1000 words):\n          president  word  count  total_words  rate_per_1000\n24     Barack Obama     i    857       106566       8.041965\n25     Barack Obama    me    120       106566       1.126063\n26     Barack Obama    my    180       106566       1.689094\n27     Barack Obama   our   1811       106566      16.994163\n28     Barack Obama    us    287       106566       2.693167\n29     Barack Obama    we   1927       106566      18.082691\n30     Barack Obama   you    349       106566       3.274966\n31     Barack Obama  your    113       106566       1.060376\n56  Donald J.

Trump   our    331        15058      21.981671\n60  Donald J. Trump    us     55        15058       3.652543\n61  Donald J. Trump    we    319        15058      21.184752\n62  Donald J. Trump   you     35        15058       2.324346\n\n\n\n\n10.5 Visualizing Style Differences\nLet’s compare how different presidents use “I” vs “we”:\n\n# Focus on 'I' and 'we'\ni_we_df = pronoun_by_president[pronoun_by_president['word'].isin(['i', 'we'])].copy()\n\n# Pivot for easier plotting\ni_we_pivot = i_we_df.pivot(index='president', columns='word', values='rate_per_1000').fillna(0)\n\n# Get presidents with most speeches for clearer visualization\ntop_presidents = (tokens_df['president']\n                  .value_counts()\n                  .head(10)\n                  .index)\n\ni_we_plot = i_we_pivot.loc[i_we_pivot.index.isin(top_presidents)]\n\n# Create scatter plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.scatter(i_we_plot['i'], i_we_plot['we'], s=100, alpha=0.6)\n\n# Label points\nfor idx, row in i_we_plot.iterrows():\n    # Shorten long names\n    name = idx.split()[-1]  # Just last name\n    plt.annotate(name, (row['i'], row['we']), \n                xytext=(5, 5), textcoords='offset points', fontsize=9)\n\nplt.xlabel('Rate of \"I\" (per 1000 words)', fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel('Rate of \"we\" (per 1000 words)', fontsize=12)\nplt.title('Presidential Pronoun Usage: \"I\" vs \"We\"', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\nplt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📌 What This Tells Us\n\n\n\nPresidents who use “I” more often might be:\n\nSpeaking in a more personal style\nTaking individual responsibility\nModern era (contemporary style)\n\nPresidents who use “we” more might be:\n\nEmphasizing collective action\nSpeaking for the nation\nEarlier era (formal style)\n\nThese patterns can distinguish authors even when topics overlap!\n\n\n\n\n10.6 The Role of PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\nIn a full stylometric analysis, we would:\n\nCount many function words (not just pronouns)\nHave dozens or hundreds of features\nNeed to reduce complexity to visualize patterns\n\nPCA (Principal Component Analysis) helps by:\n\nFinding the main “directions” of variation\nReducing many features to 2-3 dimensions\nAllowing us to plot and compare texts\n\nWhat PCA gives us (practically):\n\nA 2D plot where similar authors cluster together\nAbility to spot outliers or disputed authorship\nQuantified measure of stylistic distance\n\nWe won’t dive into the mathematics here, but know that PCA is a standard tool for reducing complex data to interpretable patterns."

Don’t worry if you don’t understand it yet - that’s what we’re here to learn!\n\nmessage = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(message)\n\nHello, World!\n\n\n\nWhat Just Happened?\nLet’s break down this code:\n\nmessage = \"Hello, World!\" - This creates a variable named message and stores the text “Hello, World!” in it\nprint(message) - This tells Python to display the contents of the message variable\n\nThink of a variable like a labeled box where you can store information. The = sign means “store the value on the right into the variable on the left”.\n\n\nExercise 2.1\nCopy the following code into Google Colab and run it:\n\nmessage = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(message)\n\nHello, World!\n\n\nNow modify it:\n\nChange \"Hello, World!\" to \"Python is fun!\" and run the code again\nChange the variable name from message to greeting (remember to change it in both places!)\nAdd another line: print(\"My first Python program\") and run the code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Tip\n\n\n\nVariable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or underscore.

This is one of the most important skills for working with Python!\n\nUsing Python’s Built-in Help\nPython has a built-in help() function that shows you information about functions and objects.\n\nhelp(print)\n\nThis will display documentation about the print function, including how to use it.\n\n\n\nUsing the help() function\n\n\n\n\nUsing dir() to Explore\nThe dir() function shows you what methods and attributes are available for an object:\n\ntext = \"hello\"\ndir(text)\n\n['__add__',\n '__class__',\n '__contains__',\n '__delattr__',\n '__dir__',\n '__doc__',\n '__eq__',\n '__format__',\n '__ge__',\n '__getattribute__',\n '__getitem__',\n '__getnewargs__',\n '__getstate__',\n '__gt__',\n '__hash__',\n '__init__',\n '__init_subclass__',\n '__iter__',\n '__le__',\n '__len__',\n '__lt__',\n '__mod__',\n '__mul__',\n '__ne__',\n '__new__',\n '__reduce__',\n '__reduce_ex__',\n '__repr__',\n '__rmod__',\n '__rmul__',\n '__setattr__',\n '__sizeof__',\n '__str__',\n '__subclasshook__',\n 'capitalize',\n 'casefold',\n 'center',\n 'count',\n 'encode',\n 'endswith',\n 'expandtabs',\n 'find',\n 'format',\n 'format_map',\n 'index',\n 'isalnum',\n 'isalpha',\n 'isascii',\n 'isdecimal',\n 'isdigit',\n 'isidentifier',\n 'islower',\n 'isnumeric',\n 'isprintable',\n 'isspace',\n 'istitle',\n 'isupper',\n 'join',\n 'ljust',\n 'lower',\n 'lstrip',\n 'maketrans',\n 'partition',\n 'removeprefix',\n 'removesuffix',\n 'replace',\n 'rfind',\n 'rindex',\n 'rjust',\n 'rpartition',\n 'rsplit',\n 'rstrip',\n 'split',\n 'splitlines',\n 'startswith',\n 'strip',\n 'swapcase',\n 'title',\n 'translate',\n 'upper',\n 'zfill']\n\n\nThis shows all the things you can do with a string. Methods that start with _ are internal - focus on the others like upper, lower, split, etc.\n\n\nReading Official Python Documentation\nThe official Python documentation is at https://docs.python.org. It’s comprehensive and well-organized.\nFor beginners, the Python Tutorial section is especially helpful: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/\n\n\n\nPython documentation\n\n\n\n\nSearching Online Effectively\nWhen you have a question or encounter an error:\n\nGoogle your question - Include “python” in your search\n\nGood: “python how to convert string to lowercase”\nBad: “make text smaller”\n\nStack Overflow - A Q&A site where programmers help each other\n\nLook for questions with many upvotes and accepted answers (green checkmark)\nRead the question to make sure it matches your problem\n\nRead the error message - Python error messages often tell you exactly what’s wrong\n\nWe’ll cover this in detail in the optional debugging section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Tip\n\n\n\nWhen searching for help, include the Python version you’re using. Google Colab typically uses Python 3, so add “python 3” to your searches.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.1\nIn Google Colab, try the following:\n\nRun help(len) - what does the len() function do?\nCreate a variable: word = \"Python\", then run dir(word)\nFind a method in the output that sounds interesting (like upper or lower)\nTry using it: word.upper() or word.lower()\nUse help(word.upper) to learn more about that method"

    "text": "4. Basic Data Types\nPython works with different types of data. Let’s explore the most important ones for text and data analysis.\n\nStrings\nStrings are text data - anything you can type. They’re enclosed in quotes (either \" or ').\n\nauthor = \"Virginia Woolf\"\ntitle = 'Mrs Dalloway'\nsentence = \"She said, 'I love Python!'\"\n\n\nString Operations\nConcatenation (joining strings):\n\nfirst_name = \"Ada\"\nlast_name = \"Lovelace\"\nfull_name = first_name + \" \" + last_name\nprint(full_name)\n\nAda Lovelace\n\n\nGetting string length:\n\ntext = \"Hello\"\nlength = len(text)\nprint(length)\n\n5\n\n\n\ntext = \"Python\"\nprint(text[0])      # First character\nprint(text[1])      # Second character\nprint(text[-1])     # Last character\nprint(text[0:3])    # Characters 0, 1, 2 (not 3)\nprint(text[2:])     # From character 2 to the end\n\nP\ny\nn\nPyt\nthon\n\n\n\n\nString Methods\nStrings have many built-in methods (functions that belong to strings):\nChanging case:\n\ntext = \"Hello World\"\nprint(text.lower())\nprint(text.upper())\n\nhello world\nHELLO WORLD\n\n\n\nsentence = \"Python is great for text analysis\"\nwords = sentence.split()\nprint(words)\n\n['Python', 'is', 'great', 'for', 'text', 'analysis']\n\n\n\ntext = \"I like cats\"\nnew_text = text.replace(\"cats\", \"dogs\")\nprint(new_text)\n\nI like dogs\n\n\n\ntext = \"   hello   \"\nprint(text.strip())\n\nhello\n\n\n\nsentence = \"Python is amazing\"\nposition = sentence.find(\"is\")\nprint(position)\n\n7\n\n\n\ntext = \"how much wood would a woodchuck chuck\"\ncount = text.count(\"wood\")\nprint(count)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nString Formatting with f-strings\nF-strings let you insert variable values into strings easily:\n\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 25\nmessage = f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old\"\nprint(message)\n\nMy name is Alice and I am 25 years old\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.1\nCopy this code into Colab:\n\nbook_title = \"pride and prejudice\"\nauthor = \"Jane Austen\"\n\nModify the code to:\n\nConvert book_title to title case using .title() and print it\nMake author all uppercase and print it\nCreate a sentence using an f-string: \"The book {book_title} was written by {author}\"\nUse .split() on book_title to separate it into words and print the result\nCount how many times the letter “e” appears in book_title\n\n\n\nNumbers\nPython works with two main types of numbers:\nIntegers (whole numbers):\n\npages = 324\nchapters = 12\n\nFloats (decimal numbers):\n\nprice = 19.99\nrating = 4.5\n\n\nArithmetic Operations\n\n# Basic arithmetic\nprint(10 + 5)      # Addition: 15\nprint(10 - 5)      # Subtraction: 5\nprint(10 * 5)      # Multiplication: 50\nprint(10 / 5)      # Division: 2.0 (always returns float)\nprint(10 // 3)     # Integer division: 3 (rounds down)\nprint(10 % 3)      # Modulo (remainder): 1\nprint(10 ** 2)     # Exponentiation: 100\n\n15\n5\n50\n2.0\n3\n1\n100\n\n\n\n\nType Conversion\nSometimes you need to convert between strings and numbers:\n\n# String to number\ntext_number = \"42\"\nnumber = int(text_number)\nprint(number + 8)  # Output: 50\n\n# Number to string\nage = 25\nmessage = \"I am \" + str(age) + \" years old\"\nprint(message)\n\n50\nI am 25 years old\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning⚠️ Warning\n\n\n\nYou cannot directly concatenate strings and numbers. You’ll get an error if you try \"Age: \" + 25. Convert the number to a string first: \"Age: \" + str(25), or use an f-string: f\"Age: {25}\".\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.2\nCopy this code into Colab:\n\ntotal_words = 1000\npages = 5\n\nModify the code to:\n\nCalculate words per page by dividing total_words by pages and print it\nCreate a variable additional_pages = 3 and calculate the new total pages\nConvert the result to a string and create a message: \"The document has X pages\" (use f-string)\nCalculate how many pages you’d have if you doubled the current number\n\n\n\nBooleans\nBooleans represent True or False values. They’re essential for making decisions in code.\n\nis_published = True\nis_draft = False\n\n\nComparison Operators\nThese operators compare values and return True or False:\n\nx = 10\ny = 5\n\nprint(x &gt; y)       # Greater than: True\nprint(x &lt; y)       # Less than: False\nprint(x == y)      # Equal to: False\nprint(x != y)      # Not equal to: True\nprint(x &gt;= 10)     # Greater than or equal: True\nprint(x &lt;= 5)      # Less than or equal: False\n\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📌 Key Point\n\n\n\nUse == to compare values (equality test) and = to assign values to variables. This is a common source of confusion!\n\n\nYou can also compare strings:\n\nword1 = \"apple\"\nword2 = \"banana\"\nprint(word1 == word2)    # False\nprint(word1 &lt; word2)     # True (alphabetical order)\n\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.3\nCopy this code into Colab:\n\nword_count = 150\nminimum_required = 100\n\nModify the code to:\n\nCheck if word_count is greater than minimum_required and print the result\nCheck if word_count equals 150 and print the result\nCheck if word_count is not equal to 200 and print the result\nChange word_count to 75 and run the comparisons again"

Use \"a\" (append mode) to add to the end of an existing file instead.\n\n\nAppending to a file:\n\nwith open(\"output.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n    file.write(\"This line is added to the end.\\n\")\n\nWriting multiple lines:\n\nlines = [\"First line\\n\", \"Second line\\n\", \"Third line\\n\"]\nwith open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.writelines(lines)\n\n\n\nFile Paths in Google Colab\nIn Google Colab, you can:\n\nUpload files using the file browser on the left (folder icon)\nCreate files in code cells\nMount Google Drive to access your Drive files\n\n\n\n\nUploading files in Colab. (1) Press “folder” icon. (2) The upload button.\n\n\nCreating a sample file in Colab:\n\n# Create a sample file to practice with\nwith open(\"sample.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(\"This is line 1\\n\")\n    file.write(\"This is line 2\\n\")\n    file.write(\"This is line 3\\n\")\n\n# Now read it back\nwith open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\n\nThis is line 1\nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3\n\n\n\n\n\nText Analysis Example\n\n# Count word frequencies in a file\nword_counts = {}\n\nwith open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        words = line.lower().split()\n        for word in words:\n            if word in word_counts:\n                word_counts[word] += 1\n            else:\n                word_counts[word] = 1\n\nprint(word_counts)\n\n{'this': 3, 'is': 3, 'line': 3, '1': 1, '2': 1, '3': 1}\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8.1\nCopy this code into Colab to create a sample file:\n\nwith open(\"poem.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(\"Roses are red\\n\")\n    file.write(\"Violets are blue\\n\")\n    file.write(\"Python is fun\\n\")\n    file.write(\"And so are you\\n\")\n\nNow modify the code to:\n\nRead the file and print its contents\nRead the file and print only the first two lines\nRead the file and count the total number of words across all lines\nRead the file and create a list of all words (split each line and combine)\nWrite a new file called “output.txt” with all the words in uppercase"

    "section": "9. Introduction to Packages",
    "text": "9. Introduction to Packages\nSo far, we’ve used Python’s built-in features. But Python’s real power comes from packages (also called libraries) - collections of pre-written code that add new capabilities.\n\nWhat Are Packages?\nPackages are like toolboxes. Each package contains functions and tools for specific tasks:\n\npandas - working with tabular data (like spreadsheets)\nnumpy - numerical computing and arrays\nmatplotlib - creating visualizations and charts\nnltk - natural language processing and text analysis\nscikit-learn - machine learning\n\n\n\nImporting Packages\nTo use a package, you import it:\n\nimport math\n\n# Now you can use functions from the math package\nresult = math.sqrt(16)\nprint(result)\n\n4.0\n\n\n\nimport math as m\n\nresult = m.sqrt(25)\nprint(result)\n\n5.0\n\n\n\nfrom math import sqrt, pi\n\nprint(sqrt(9))\nprint(pi)\n\n3.0\n3.141592653589793\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Packages in Colab\nMost common packages are already installed in Google Colab. If you need to install a package, use:\n!pip install package-name\nThe ! tells Colab to run this as a shell command, not Python code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📌 Key Point\n\n\n\nIn Colab, you usually don’t need to install packages. Just import them! We’ll discuss installing packages locally in the next section.\n\n\n\n\nExample: Reading CSV with Pandas\nLet’s see a quick example using pandas to work with tabular data:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a sample dataset\ndata = {\n    \"book\": [\"1984\", \"Brave New World\", \"Fahrenheit 451\"],\n    \"author\": [\"George Orwell\", \"Aldous Huxley\", \"Ray Bradbury\"],\n    \"year\": [1949, 1932, 1953],\n    \"pages\": [328, 311, 249]\n}\n\n# Create a DataFrame (pandas' table structure)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Display the data\nprint(df)\n\n              book         author  year  pages\n0             1984  George Orwell  1949    328\n1  Brave New World  Aldous Huxley  1932    311\n2   Fahrenheit 451   Ray Bradbury  1953    249\n\n\n\nprint(df[\"book\"])\nprint(df[\"year\"])\n\n0               1984\n1    Brave New World\n2     Fahrenheit 451\nName: book, dtype: object\n0    1949\n1    1932\n2    1953\nName: year, dtype: int64\n\n\nFiltering data:\n\n# Books published after 1940\nrecent_books = df[df[\"year\"] &gt; 1940]\nprint(recent_books)\n\n             book         author  year  pages\n0            1984  George Orwell  1949    328\n2  Fahrenheit 451   Ray Bradbury  1953    249\n\n\nBasic statistics:\n\nprint(f\"Average pages: {df['pages'].mean()}\")\nprint(f\"Earliest year: {df['year'].min()}\")\n\nAverage pages: 296.0\nEarliest year: 1932\n\n\nReading from a CSV file:\n\n# Create a sample CSV file first\nwith open(\"books.csv\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(\"book,author,year,pages\\n\")\n    file.write(\"1984,George Orwell,1949,328\\n\")\n    file.write(\"Brave New World,Aldous Huxley,1932,311\\n\")\n\n# Read it with pandas\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"books.csv\")\nprint(df)\n\n              book         author  year  pages\n0             1984  George Orwell  1949    328\n1  Brave New World  Aldous Huxley  1932    311\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Tip\n\n\n\nPandas is incredibly powerful for data analysis. We’ll explore it more deeply when working with real datasets. For now, just know that it exists and can read CSV files easily!\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9.1\nCopy this code into Colab:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    \"word\": [\"the\", \"and\", \"to\", \"of\"],\n    \"count\": [150, 89, 76, 72]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nModify the code to:\n\nPrint the entire DataFrame\nPrint only the “word” column\nPrint only the “count” column\nFind the maximum count using df[\"count\"].max()\nFind the minimum count using df[\"count\"].min()"

    "section": "10. Local Python Environments",
    "text": "10. Local Python Environments\nSo far, we’ve been using Google Colab, which runs Python in the cloud. But you might want to run Python on your own computer. Let’s explore why and how.\n\nCloud vs. Local Development\nGoogle Colab (Cloud):\n\n✓ No installation needed\n✓ Works on any computer with a browser\n✓ Free access to computing resources\n✗ Requires internet connection\n✗ Sessions timeout after inactivity\n✗ Uses your Google Drive storage\n✗ Some packages may not work\n\nLocal Python (Your Computer):\n\n✓ Works offline\n✓ Full control over environment\n✓ No session timeouts\n✓ All packages available\n✗ Requires installation and setup\n✗ Uses your computer’s resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📌 Key Point\n\n\n\nFor learning and quick experiments, Colab is perfect. For larger projects or when you need specific packages, local Python is better.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to uv (Recommended)\nuv is a modern, fast Python package and project manager. We recommend it because it’s:\n\nVery fast (much faster than traditional tools)\nEasy to use\nHandles both Python installation and package management\nBecoming the industry standard\n\nLear more about uv here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\n\nInstalling uv\nOn macOS and Linux:\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nOn Windows:\npowershell -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\nAfter installation, close and reopen your terminal.\n\n\nUsing uv\nCreate a new Python project:\nuv init my-project\ncd my-project\nThis creates a new directory with a basic Python project structure.\nInstall a package:\nuv add pandas\nThis installs pandas and adds it to your project’s dependencies.\nRun Python:\nuv run python\nThis starts a Python interpreter with your project’s packages available.\nRun a Python script:\nuv run python my_script.py\nInstall a specific Python version:\nuv python install 3.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Tip\n\n\n\nuv automatically creates isolated environments for each project, so different projects can use different package versions without conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Conda (Fallback Option)\nConda is a more established tool that also manages Python environments and packages. It’s widely used in data science.\n\nInstalling Conda\nDownload and install Miniconda (a minimal conda installation) from: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\nChoose the installer for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.\n\n\n\nMiniconda download page. At the bottom of https://www.anaconda.com/download\n\n\n\n\n\nMiniconda download page. Then choose “Miniconda Installers”\n\n\n\n\nUsing Conda\nCreate a new environment:\nconda create -n my-env python=3.11\nThis creates a new environment named “my-env” with Python 3.11.\nActivate the environment:\nconda activate my-env\nInstall packages:\nconda install pandas\nDeactivate the environment:\nconda deactivate\nList all environments:\nconda env list\nRemove an environment:\nconda remove -n my-env --all\n\n\n\nUsing Jupyter Locally\nOnce you have Python installed locally (with either uv or conda), you can run Jupyter notebooks on your computer.\nWith uv:\nuv add jupyter\nuv run jupyter notebook\nWith conda:\nconda install jupyter\njupyter notebook\nThis opens Jupyter in your web browser, running locally on your computer.\n\n\n\nJupyter running locally\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter running locally. A new notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter running locally. Always have a Python kernel selected.\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter running locally. Some useful UI elements.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Use Which Tool\nUse uv when:\n\nStarting a new project\nYou want the fastest tool\nYou’re working on modern Python projects\nYou want the latest features\n\nUse conda when:\n\nWorking with data science packages (it handles dependencies well)\nYou need packages that aren’t on PyPI (Python Package Index)\nYou’re following tutorials that use conda\nYou need packages that require complex non-Python dependencies\n\nUse Colab when:\n\nLearning and experimenting\nYou don’t have Python installed locally\nYou need quick access from any computer\nYou’re sharing code with others who may not have Python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Tip\n\n\n\nMany people use multiple tools: Colab for quick experiments and learning, uv for new projects, and conda for data science work. You don’t have to choose just one!\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10.1\nThis exercise requires setting up on your local computer (optional):\n\nInstall uv following the instructions for your operating system\nCreate a new project called “python-practice”\nAdd the pandas package to your project\nCreate a file called test.py with this code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nprint(\"Pandas version:\", pd.__version__)\n\nPandas version: 2.3.3\n\n\nRun the file using uv run python test.py\n\nAlternative exercise with conda:\n\nInstall Miniconda following the instructions for your operating system\nCreate a new environment called “test-env” with Python 3.11\nActivate the environment\nInstall pandas\nRun Python and import pandas to verify it works"

Using = Instead of ==\n\n# Wrong (assignment, not comparison)\nif x = 5:\n    print(\"Five\")\n\n# Right\nif x == 5:\n    print(\"Five\")\n\n\n  Cell In[111], line 2\n    if x = 5:\n       ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Forgetting Quotes Around Strings\n\n# Wrong\nmessage = Hello\n\n# Right\nmessage = \"Hello\"\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[112], line 2\n      1 # Wrong\n----&gt; 2 message = Hello\n      4 # Right\n      5 message = \"Hello\"\n\nNameError: name 'Hello' is not defined\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Modifying a List While Iterating\n\n# Problematic\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        numbers.remove(num)  # Modifying while iterating!\n\n# Better\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnumbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n\n\n\n6. Not Converting Types\n\n# Wrong\nage = input(\"Enter age: \")\nif age &gt; 18:  # Comparing string to number!\n    print(\"Adult\")\n\n# Right\nage = int(input(\"Enter age: \"))\nif age &gt; 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")\n\n\n\n\nDebugging Strategies\n\n1. Print Debugging\nAdd print statements to see what’s happening:\n\ndef calculate(x, y):\n    print(f\"x = {x}, y = {y}\")  # Debug print\n    result = x * y\n    print(f\"result = {result}\")  # Debug print\n    return result\n\n\n\n2. Check Variable Types\nUse type() to verify types:\n\nx = \"42\"\nprint(type(x))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;\nx = int(x)\nprint(type(x))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\n&lt;class 'str'&gt;\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n3. Test Small Parts\nBreak your code into smaller pieces and test each part:\n# Instead of this all at once:\nresult = data.split()[0].upper().replace(\"X\", \"Y\")\n\n# Test step by step:\nstep1 = data.split()\nprint(step1)\nstep2 = step1[0]\nprint(step2)\nstep3 = step2.upper()\nprint(step3)\nresult = step3.replace(\"X\", \"Y\")\nprint(result)\n\n\n4. Use Try-Except (Advanced)\nHandle errors gracefully:\n\ntry:\n    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    result = 100 / number\n    print(result)\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n\n\n\n5. Read Documentation\nUse help() to understand how functions work:\n\nhelp(str.split)\n\n\n\n6. Search the Error\nCopy the error message (without your specific variable names) and search online:\n\nGood search: “python NameError name not defined”\nLess helpful: “my code doesn’t work”\n\n\n\n\nExercise A.1\nEach code snippet below has an error. Copy them into Colab one at a time and:\n\nRun the code and read the error message\nIdentify what type of error it is\nFix the error\n\nCode snippets:\n\n# Error 1\nprint(\"Hello World\"\n\n\n  Cell In[116], line 2\n    print(\"Hello World\"\n                       ^\n_IncompleteInputError: incomplete input\n\n\n\n\n\n# Error 2\nage = 25\nmessage = \"I am \" + age + \" years old\"\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[117], line 3\n      1 # Error 2\n      2 age = 25\n----&gt; 3 message = \"I am \" + age + \" years old\"\n\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n\n\n\n\n# Error 3\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nprint(words[3])\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[118], line 3\n      1 # Error 3\n      2 words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n----&gt; 3 print(words[3])\n\nIndexError: list index out of range\n\n\n\n\n# Error 4\ndef greet():\nprint(\"Hello\")\n\n\n  Cell In[119], line 3\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    ^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block after function definition on line 2\n\n\n\n\n\n# Error 5\nx = 10\nif x &gt; 5\n    print(\"Big number\")\n\n\n  Cell In[120], line 3\n    if x &gt; 5\n            ^\nSyntaxError: expected ':'\n\n\n\n\n\n# Error 6\nbook = {\"title\": \"1984\", \"author\": \"Orwell\"}\nprint(book[\"year\"])\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[121], line 3\n      1 # Error 6\n      2 book = {\"title\": \"1984\", \"author\": \"Orwell\"}\n----&gt; 3 print(book[\"year\"])\n\nKeyError: 'year'\n\n\n\n\n# Error 7\ntext = \"Python\"\nresult = text.find()\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[122], line 3\n      1 # Error 7\n      2 text = \"Python\"\n----&gt; 3 result = text.find()\n\nTypeError: find expected at least 1 argument, got 0\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Debugging Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Tips for Effective Debugging\n\n\n\n\nRead the error message carefully - Python tells you exactly what’s wrong\nCheck line numbers - But remember, the actual error might be on a previous line\nLook for typos - Variable names, function names, syntax\nVerify your assumptions - Use print() to check what values variables actually have\nSearch for help - You’re probably not the first person with this error\nTake breaks - Sometimes stepping away helps you see the problem fresh\nStart simple - Comment out code to isolate the problem\nDon’t panic - Every programmer deals with errors constantly. It’s normal!\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Tutorial\nYou now have a comprehensive reference for Python basics, from running your first code to debugging errors.
